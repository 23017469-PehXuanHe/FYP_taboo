guess.html is the updated one i uploaded 2 files so we can always double back


In order for the vosk model to work you need to download these dependencies:
pip install flask
pip install python

you also need to chnage the path of the file to where the downloaded vosk model is located\
eg. C:\C300 Programs\vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15\vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 ... ensure that "r" is not deleted as this ensures that the program takes this exact path
